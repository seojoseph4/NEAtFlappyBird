# Flappy Bird AI with NEAT

This project uses the NEAT algorithm to train an AI agent to play Flappy Bird autonomously. Dynamic oscillating obstacles enhance difficulty, testing the AI's adaptability and learning capabilities.

## Features
- **Optimized Training**: Achieves convergence in 3 generations, reducing training time by 84% compared to the initial 19.3 generations.
- **Strong Performance**: AI consistently navigates past 50+ pipes, even with dynamic oscillating obstacles.
- **Challenging Gameplay**: Introduced oscillating pipes to increase complexity and push AI performance.
